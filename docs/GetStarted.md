## Local Development

What you need to know about development of Telegram Mini Apps and bot:

- Telegram Test Environment
- Telegram Debug Mode
- Local ports forwarding through ngrok

### About Telegram Test Environment

Telegram has a test environment that allows you to test your bots without affecting the production environment.
The database of users in the test environment is separate from the production environment.

Read more: [Using bots in the test environment](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#using-bots-in-the-test-environment)

It is recommended to use the test environment for development and testing of bots.

### Telegram Debug Mode

It is a special mode of Telegram clients allowing to debug and inspect Mini Apps

#### Debug Mode on Android devices

Note. Official guide does not contain information about how to enable debug mode on Android devices.
However, it is possible:

- Download [Telegram Beta](https://install.appcenter.ms/users/drklo-2kb-ghpo/apps/Telegram-Beta-2/distribution_groups/All-users-of-Telegram-Beta-2) android client
- On login, entered your number and check the "Test Backend" mark.
- Scan the QR code

### Ports forwarding using ngrok

To test your Mini App or Bot you need to give its URL to @BotFather. It does not accept local URLs so you'll need port forwarding.

Ngrok ‚Äî is util that allows you to expose your local ports to the internet. We need to expose two ports: both for client and server.

1. [Install ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/#step-2-install-the-ngrok-agent)
2. Sigh up and get Auth Token
3. Copy ngrok.yml.example to ngrok.yml
4. Fill it with your token and local ports
5. Run ngrok using config:

```
ngrok start --all --config ./ngrok.yml
```

You'll see public hosts assigned to you. Send Client host to BotFather, and fill both client and server .env files with them
